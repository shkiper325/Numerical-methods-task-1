### This is solution of ODE using special method for my university task

**Notice:** you need *pentapy*, *numpy* and *matplotlib* python3 libraries to use this repo code. You can simply install them using pip.

To build, completely test solution and create plot just run

    ./test.bash

Plot will be avaliable in file *plot.png*.

You can just build binary solver with

    ./build.bash

Syntax:

    ./main N I

where N + 1 is amount of points in solution greed and I + 1 is amount of points in numerical integration greed.
