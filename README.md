### This is solution of ODE using special method for my university task

To build, fully test solution and create plot run

    ./test.bash

You can just build binary solver with

    ./build.bash

Syntax:

    ./main N I
where N + 1 is amount of points in solution greed and I + 1 is amount of points in numerical integration greed.
